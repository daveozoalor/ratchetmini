# RatchetMini Hybrid Android/iOS app

is a sample android/iOS app built with [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com). Ratchet helps you build mobile apps with simple HTML, CSS, and JS components.


## Getting started
Nothing special, just your usual HTML, CSS and Javascript files. Ratchet is very easy to pickup if you are already familiar with some of those.
* Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/daveozoalor/ratchetmini.git` or just [download](https://github.com/daveozoalor/ratchetmini/archive/master.zip) the bundled CSS and JS
* [Read the docs on Ratchet's website ](http://goratchet.com) to learn about the components and how to get a prototype on your phone


### What's included

This is the structure of the files and folders you will see in the downloaded app. The app uses the default settins of Ratchet, Ratchet logically groups common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:
